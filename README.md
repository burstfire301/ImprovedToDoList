## Why Does ImprovedToDoList Exist?
I wanted to make a TODO list app to learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and git. I have since worked as a Software Intern at Plugin Accountant and Victoria University of Wellington working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and git. Now I improve the app for my personal productivity and to practice what I have learned - both professionally and at university.
