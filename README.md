## Why Does ImprovedToDoList Exist?
I wanted to make a TODO list app to learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and git. I have since worked as a Software Intern at Trimble Inc., Plugin Accountant, and Victoria University of Wellington working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and git. Now I improve this app for my personal productivity and to practice what I have learned - both professionally and at university. My goal is to make this app useful for friends and family also by adding a database, hosting the app, and adding some basic cyber security measures.
